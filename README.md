# smart-class-attendance-system
The Smart Class Attendance System utilizes OpenCV and other modern technologies to automate the attendance process by detecting students' faces during class. 

The system captures real-time images or videos, processes them using facial recognition algorithms, and automatically marks attendance based on student identification.
OpenCV: For real-time face detection and face recognition to identify students and mark attendance.

Tkinter: For creating an interactive user interface (UI) that enables students and administrators to easily interact with the system.

Real-Time Processing: Face detection happens in real-time via a webcam, instantly recording attendance when a studentâ€™s face is recognized.
Database Integration: SQL database stores student data, attendance history, and facial images, ensuring efficient management of records.
